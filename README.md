# [ENGi v0.5.0](http://ajhager.com/engi)

A multi-platform 2D game library for Go.

## Status

*SUPER ALPHA* Expect bugs and major API changes. Just a proof of concept at the moment.

## Desktop

The desktop backend depends on glfw3, but the package includes the source code and links it statically.

## Web

The web backend depends on [gopherjs](http://github.com/neelance/gopherjs). Check out the [SERVi](http://github.com/ajhager/engi/tree/master/srvi) utility for testing your games in the browser.

## Install

```bash
go get -u github.com/ajhager/engi
```
